Java client library for MogileFS (http://www.danga.com/mogilefs/). Code
is mostly a copy of the perl client.

This is a fork of eml's MogileFS Java client. 
This client supports additional MogileFS client features such as list keys. 

I am planning to clean up the source code; add generics, utilize JUnit testing,
switch to slf4j logging and develop for Java 1.5+ and up features.

Choose one of the classes in com.guba.mogilefs that implements
the MogileFS interface:

SimpleMogileFSImpl - simplest implementation that holds a single
	connection to a mogile tracker. Shouldn't be used by
	multiple threads.
PooledMogileFSImpl - thread safe implementation that keeps a pool of
	connections open to the mogile trackers. Excellent for
	servlets to share.
LocalFileMogileFSImpl - this implementation doesn't actually talk
	to mogile servers - it just acts like it, but stores things
	locally. Its useful it you want to test something locally
	or have a fake local mogile store.

Please send bug reports to Eric Lambrecht <eml@ill.com>.
